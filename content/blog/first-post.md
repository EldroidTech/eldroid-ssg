# My First Blog Post!

I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts using this new static site generator.
Let's test some of its features.

## Code Highlighting

Here's a Rust code example:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Blog!");
}
```

And some Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Markdown Features

1. **Bold text** and *italics*
2. [Links](https://example.com)
3. Lists and nested lists:
   - Item 1
   - Item 2
     - Nested item

## Tables

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Markdown | ✅ |

| Navigation | ✅ |

## Task Lists

That's it for now! Stay tuned for more content.
